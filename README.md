Hi Humans!

Amir here.

I got an electrical/electronic engineering background but never practiced it because I was into teaching.
I just got a job as a data analyst.
So as I'll be doing data analysis, firstly I have to learn some programming languages like Python, Scala and Spark.
I had some programming basics because during my undergrad, I learned C++, Verilog, Code Composer Studio, IDE68k etc.
But I forgot them all.
I hope you all humans will help me with my learning so that I can become a good data analyst (and later a data scientist!).
